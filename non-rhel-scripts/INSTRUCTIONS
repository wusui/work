This set of scripts sets up ceph clusters for testing.

Get site talking nice to each other:
    - on Centos, remember to sudo visudo and set !requiretty
    - run ./talknice.sh vpmXXX.front.sepia.ceph.com vpmYYY.front.sepia.ceph.com
      to set up ssh communications between the two sites.
    - ssh to vpmXXX.front.sepia.ceph.com
    - from vpmXXX, ssh to vpmYYY (make sure communications work).
    - from vpmYYY, ssh to vpmXXX

Bring up Ceph:
    ./install.sh vpmXXX vpmYYY installs ceph on vpmYYY from vpmXXX.

Bring up Rgw:
    ./remotergw.sh vpmXXX vpmYYY installs radosgw on vpmYYY from vpmXXX.
