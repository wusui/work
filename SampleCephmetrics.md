# cephmetrics

Cephmetrics is a tool that allows a user to visually monitor various metrics in a running Ceph cluster.

## Disclaimer

This document contains the installation procedure for cephmetrics released on June 30, 2017.

## Prerequisites
- RHEL 7 should be running on all hosts
- A functional ceph cluster running version ceph-osd-10.2.7-27.el7cp.x86_64 or later is already up and running.
- Another host machine independent of the ceph machines must be available.  This host will be used to receive data pushed by the hosts in the Ceph cluster, and will run the dashboard to display that data.
- A host machine on which to execute `ansible-playbook` to orchestrate the deployment must be available.  In this document, this will be the same host as the dashboard host.
- Passwordless SSH access from the deploy host to the ceph hosts. The username should be the same for all hosts.
- Passwordless sudo access on the ceph and dashboard hosts
- All hosts must share the same DNS domain

## Installation

### Install executables

On the host machine on which you will run ansible-playbook, do the following:
```
- sudo su -
- mkdir ~/cephmetrics
- subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rhscon-2-installer-rpms
- cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
- curl -L -o cephmetrics-deps.repo https://chacra.ceph.com/repos/cephmetrics/dependencies/HEAD/rhel/7/repo
- sed -i -e 's/\[cephmetrics/\[cephmetrics-deps/' cephmetrics-deps.repo
- curl -L -o cephmetrics.repo https://shaman.ceph.com/api/repos/cephmetrics/master/latest/centos/7/repo/
- yum install cephmetrics-ansible
```

### Edit the inventory file

A file named ~/cephmetrics/inventory needs to be created.  Ansible-playbook will use this inventory file when installing cephmetrics.  Inventory is an INI-like format file with entries for ceph-grafana and all the parts of the ceph cluster.  Its format looks like:

    [ceph-grafana]
    cephmetrics.example.com ansible_connection=local

    [osds]
    osd0.example.com
    osd1.example.com
    osd2.example.com

    [mons]
    mon0.example.com
    mon1.example.com
    mon2.example.com

    [mdss]
    mds0.example.com

    [rgws]
    rgw0.example.com

Omit the mdss section if no ceph mds nodes are installed.  Omit the rgws section if no rgw nodes are installed.

## Edit the vars.yml file

Vars.yml is used to override defaults used by the ansible installation procedure.  Run the following:
- echo "devel_mode: false" > ~/cephmetrics/vars.yml

There are other variables that can be set if the user so desires.  See ./ansible/ansible.md for more information.

## Run the ansible-playbook

Run the following command:
- ansible-playbook -v -i \~/cephmetrics/inventory -e '@\~/cephmetrics/vars.yml' playbook.yml
